Colour Image Processing

Using programming language C++ and Qt framework an application that processes color images has been implemented. The application has the following features:

    -> Graphical user interface that allows the user to open image files and process it;
    -> It supports the majority of standard raster image formats (jpg, png, bmp, tiff) and can both load and save these type of files;
    -> The program supports the following color models: RGB, CMY, CMYK and HSI;
    -> The program allows the user to the image pixel data between the above color models;
    -> The program displays the histograms for any of the color models;
    -> The program allows the user to modify a given value of a given color channel globally for the entire image, and displays the resulting image;
    -> The resulting image can be stored as a file.
